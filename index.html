Coding is a tool for mathematics. Through learning fun coding, kids will learn how mathematics is closely related to coding. It is also a tool that helps improve logical thinking skills, guiding kids to reach out to different areas successfully. Coding is demanded and required. At the same time, learning to code will advantage and benefit your kids in future.

<h3>How is robotics used in daily life?</h3>
Robots are necessary factors in our lives today. We use them every day from cooking food, chores, buying products and playing games.
Robots are everywhere. Remote-control cars, drones, planes and other modern toys have common forms of robotics which allow you to control the movement of the robots in real-time. Robotics also takes its form in a less obvious way, like in vending machines and automatic doors where they use different types of sensors to detect what buttons being pressed or sense if someone is in front of the doors.
